Sure! Let's go through the code line by line:

```
.model small
.stack 100h
```
These directives specify the memory model and the size of the stack.

```
.data
    string db 100 dup('$')
    
    inmsg db "Enter string: $"
    outmsg db "Longest sequence is : $"
    
    l dw ?
    r dw ?
    fl dw ?
    fr dw ?
    prv db ? 
    
    max_len dw 0
    flag db 0
```
The `.data` section is used to declare variables and allocate memory for them. In this code, the following variables are declared:

- `string` is an array of 100 bytes, initialized with '$' characters.
- `inmsg` is a null-terminated string that will be displayed as a prompt for user input.
- `outmsg` is a null-terminated string that will be used to display the result.
- `l`, `r`, `fl`, `fr` are words (2 bytes) used as pointers to elements in the `string` array.
- `prv` is a byte used to store the previous character read from input.
- `max_len` is a word initialized to 0, used to keep track of the length of the longest sequence found.
- `flag` is a byte used as a flag to indicate whether a sequence has been found.

```
.code
main proc
```
The `.code` section is used to write the actual code. The `main` procedure is defined here.

```
mov ax, @data
mov ds, ax
```
These instructions set up the `ds` (data segment) register to point to the start of the data segment.

```
lea dx, inmsg
mov ah, 9
int 21h
```
These instructions load the offset of the `inmsg` string into the `dx` register, set the `ah` register to 9 (which represents the "print string" function), and invoke interrupt 21h to display the message.

```
lea si, string
```
This instruction loads the offset of the `string` array into the `si` register. It points to the first element of the array.

```
input:
    mov ah, 1
    int 21h
    cmp al, 13
    je break
    mov [si], al
    inc si
    jmp input
```
This is a loop that reads characters from input using interrupt 21h function 01h (read character). It checks if the read character is a carriage return (ASCII value 13) and if so, jumps to the `break` label. Otherwise, it stores the character in the memory location pointed to by `si`, increments `si`, and jumps back to the `input` label to continue reading characters.

```
break:
    call new_line
    lea si, string
    mov l, si
    mov r, si
    mov fl, si
    mov fr, si
    mov cx, 1
```
After the input loop is terminated, this code is executed. It calls the `new_line` procedure to print a new line character, resets the pointers `l`, `r`, `fl`, `fr` to the start of the `string` array, and initializes `cx` to 1.

```
worker:
    mov dl, [si]
    inc si
    mov bl, [si]
    cmp bl, '$'
    je final_chk
    cmp bl, dl
    jge include
    jl exclude
```
This is the main loop of the program. It compares adjacent

 characters in the `string` array to find sequences. It first loads the characters at the current and next positions into `dl` and `bl` registers, respectively. Then it compares `bl` to '$' to check for the end of the string. If it's not the end, it compares `bl` to `dl` to determine if the next character should be included in the sequence (jumps to `include`) or excluded (jumps to `exclude`).

```
include:
    inc cx
    mov r, si
    jmp worker
```
If the next character should be included, it increments `cx` (the count of the sequence length), updates `r` (the right pointer) to `si` (the current position), and jumps back to `worker` to continue searching for the next character.

```
final_chk:
    mov flag, 1
```
When the end of the string is reached, this code is executed, setting `flag` to 1 to indicate that a sequence has been found.

```
exclude:
    cmp cx, max_len
    jg big_found
    jle not_found
```
If the next character should be excluded, this code is executed. It compares the length of the current sequence (`cx`) to the maximum length found so far (`max_len`). If it's greater, it jumps to `big_found` to update the maximum length and the left and right pointers. Otherwise, it jumps to `not_found`.

```
big_found:
    mov max_len, cx
    mov ax, l
    mov fl, ax
    mov ax, r
    mov fr, ax
    mov l, si
    mov r, si
    mov cx, 1
    cmp flag, 1
    je output
    jmp worker
```
If the current sequence is longer than the maximum length found so far, this code is executed. It updates `max_len`, `fl`, `fr`, `l`, and `r` with the appropriate values. Then it checks if `flag` is set (indicating that a sequence has been found) and if so, it jumps to the `output` label. Otherwise, it jumps back to `worker` to search for the next sequence.

```
not_found:
    mov l, si
    mov r, si
    mov cx, 1
    cmp flag, 1
    je output
    jmp worker
```
If the current sequence is not longer than the maximum length found so far, this code is executed. It resets `l`, `r`, and `cx` to start a new search. Then it checks if `flag` is set and if so, it jumps to the `output` label. Otherwise, it jumps back to `worker` to search for the next sequence.

```
output:
    lea dx, outmsg
    mov ah, 9
    int 21h
    mov si, fl
    print:
        mov dl, [si]
        mov ah, 2
        int 21h
        inc si
        cmp si, fr
        jg exit
        jmp print
```
This code is executed after the search is completed. It prints the `outmsg` string using interrupt 21h function 09h (print string). Then it sets `si` to `fl` (the left pointer) and enters a loop that prints the characters of the longest sequence using interrupt 21h function 02h (print character). The loop continues until `si` reaches `fr` (the right pointer).

```
exit:
    mov ah, 4ch
    int 21h


```
Finally, this code sets `ah` to 4Ch (the exit function code) and invokes interrupt 21h to exit the program.

```
new_line proc
    mov ah, 2
    mov dl, 10
    int 21h
    mov dl, 13
    int 21h
    ret
new_line endp
```
This is a procedure named `new_line` that prints a new line character by invoking interrupt 21h function 02h (print character) with `dl` set to 10 (line feed) and then invokes the same function with `dl` set to 13 (carriage return). Finally, it returns from the procedure.

```
end main
```
This marks the end of the `main` procedure.

That's a complete walkthrough of the code, explaining each line's purpose and functionality.
